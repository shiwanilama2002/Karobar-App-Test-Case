The test suite for the Karobar app encompasses five key modules: Onboarding Process, Login Functionality, Sales Module, Parties Management, and UI/UX Design. The Onboarding Process module ensures a seamless experience for new users, from account creation to initial setup. Login Functionality validates secure access, including password handling and recovery. Sales Module tests record management and payment processing. Parties Management handles customer and vendor data management. UI/UX Design evaluates interface consistency, responsiveness, and navigation flow. Together, these modules ensure the functionality, security, and user experience of the Karobar app.
